Smart garden system with an Arduino and different sensors.
This program controlls light, temperature, humidity and in a future version soil moisture as well.

This project is currently a wip, so the program is not final yet and not all modules are used correctly.

List of hardware:
- Arduino Uno
- DS1307RTC
- DHT22
- HD44780 2004 LCD Display 20x4
- I2C IIC Adapter (for the LCD display)
- Relay 5V KY-019 Modul High-Level-Trigger
-
